# Signature-QBiC

Signature-QBiC (SigQBiC)

## Purpose

We developed the “Signature-QBiC” prediction model that integrates
mutational signature profiles with the QBiC method to investigate the
effect of mutational signatures on TF bindings. QBiC is trained from
protein binding microarray experiments and able to estimate the effect
of every single-nucleotide change in the center of every 11-mer. SigQBiC
has functions to predict the effects of mutational signatures on TF
binding, get QBiC scores for single nucleotide variants in the center of
an 11-mer.

### Development version

Install the latest version of SigQBiC from the master branch on
[GitHub](https://github.com/), which may not be stable:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mickyliumo/SigQBiC")
```
